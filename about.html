  <h2> Location </h2>
  <p> The half day courses are held in a dedicated computer training room, conveniently located in the Adelaide CBD.</p>
  <p> It is surrounded by carparking options (undercover car parks or public transport are recommended for the half day training courses, as on-street car parks are limited to 1-2 hours), and cafes and restaurants for pre and post sustenance, though a tea and coffee station, biscuits and some fruit are provided for no extra charge.</p>
